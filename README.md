Game points
===========

Simple browser based game points system. [Live demo](https://hqcasanova.github.io/game-points/).

Implemented with Marionette v3.2. 
Targeted at IE10+. Tested on Google Chrome v57.

Part of the interview process for the e-learning company [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com/) Usual frontend challenge where you are provided with a prototype and have to implement it as closely as possible. I passed the challenge but ended up working at a different company.
